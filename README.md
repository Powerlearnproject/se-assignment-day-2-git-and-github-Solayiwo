## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
- Version Control is a system that tracks changes made to files over time. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. The primary functions of version control include tracking of changes on a file, creating and merging of branches, collaboration on the same project and reverting changes on a project.

GitHub is a widely used platform that hosts Git repositories, offering tools for managing and sharing code. Its popularity include the following
- Integration with Git: GitHub provides a user-friendly interface for Git, a powerful distributed version control system, making it easier to use.
- Collaboration Features: GitHub allows multiple developers to work together on a project, with features like pull requests, code reviews, and discussions.
- Open Source Community: It’s a hub for open-source projects, enabling developers to collaborate on global projects, share their code, and contribute to other projects.
- Documentation and Project Management: GitHub offers tools for creating documentation, tracking issues, and managing projects, making it more than just a code repository.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitHub integrates well with
CI/CD tools, allowing automatic testing and deployment of code.
